### How to Use Confirmer?
// TODO


## For Developers
### Build Installation
```bash
# To install
foo@bar:~$ git init
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/KeiferC/Confirmer.git
foo@bar:~$ cd Confirmer

# To set up development environment on Google Apps Script
foo@bar~$ ./scripts/develop

# To deploy add-on
foo@bar:~$ ./scripts/build
foo@bar:~$ clasp deploy --versionNumber <N> --description "<MESSAGE>" 
           # <N>:       Version number (> 0)
           # <MESSAGE>: Version description
```

### Planned Features
Feel free to contribute. __Please prioritize security and accessibility.__ 
Below is a list of planned features to implement:

- Change structure to create multiple confirmer based on universal actions. 
  Allows users to set up multiple Confirmer cards.
  - Need to set up unique IDs for each Confirmer card.
  - Need to set up settings card to activate (push onto stack) when a 
    "settings" button in a status card is clicked.
- Add a setting that allows for the user to *choose* to set up a single date 
  with a consistent confirmation email schedule (e.g. every day, every week, 
  every month, etc.), instead of using a Google Sheet containing a flexible 
  schedule.
- Add feature that allows users to select the number of days prior to the 
  event in which they would like the reminder email to be sent.
- Add a setting that allows users to specify a threshold number of scheduled 
  participants required to avoid sending a warning message to self.
- Add a setting that allows the user to mute warning messages.
- Implement suggested searches for column labels (a trie data structure?)
- Add a setting where users manually set their timezone
  - JS' `Date` object relies on the client's timezone. Google's add-on API sets 
    Google as the client. Note: userTimezone.id â€” the user's timezone 
    identifier (e.g. America/New_York).

The following planned features are currently on indefinite hold until certain
features of the Google API are implemented:

- Initialize settings on install. Currently not possible due to limitations on
  `appscript.json` triggers.
- Trigger add-on build on add-on icon click. Currently not possible due to
  limitations on `appscript.json` triggers.
- Improve add-on's aesthetic design. Currently not possible due to styling
  limitations of the Google CardService API.
