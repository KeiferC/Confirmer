### Installation from Github

> Note: This installation tutorial assumes a fundamental understanding of working
>       with the command-line (e.g. an understanding of directory traversals).

0. __Open a command-line shell (Linux / Mac OSX: Terminal. Windows: Powershell).__

    - Install `git` if it is not installed. The tutorial can be found
      [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
    - Install `npm` if it is not installed The tutorial can be found
      [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

1. __Set up your add-on's environment with the following commands:__

```bash
foo@bar:~$ git init
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/KeiferC/Confirmer.git
foo@bar:~$ cd Confirmer
foo@bar:~$ ./scripts/config
```
  - When prompted on your shell, type your computer password and press the
    enter / return key. The installation requires admin privileges to install
    UglifyJS and `clasp`.

    ```bash
    # For example
    foo@bar:~$ ./script/config
    password: # Enter password here
    ```

  - Google will open a web browser and will ask you to login to your Google
    Account in order to allow `clasp` to access your account. Click "allow" 
    when prompted.

2. __Run the following command to build and upload the add-on to your Google 
  Account:__

```bash

```

  - When prompted by `clasp` on your shell, type `y` and press the enter / 
    return key.

    ```bash
    # For example
    ? Manifest file has been updated. Do you want to push and overwrite? (y/N) y
    ```

### How to Use Confirmer?
// TODO


## For Developers
### Build Installation
```bash
# To install
foo@bar:~$ git init
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/KeiferC/Confirmer.git
foo@bar:~$ cd Confirmer

# To set up development environment on Google Apps Script
foo@bar~$ ./scripts/develop

# To deploy add-on
foo@bar:~$ ./scripts/build
foo@bar:~$ clasp deploy --versionNumber <N> --description "<MESSAGE>" 
           # <N>:       Version number (> 0)
           # <MESSAGE>: Version description
```

### Planned Features
Feel free to contribute. __Please prioritize security and accessibility.__ 
Below is a list of planned features to implement:

- Change structure to create multiple confirmer based on universal actions. 
  Allows users to set up multiple Confirmer cards.
  - Need to set up unique IDs for each Confirmer card.
  - Need to set up settings card to activate (push onto stack) when a 
    "settings" button in a status card is clicked.
- Add a setting that allows for the user to *choose* to set up a single date 
  with a consistent confirmation email schedule (e.g. every day, every week, 
  every month, etc.), instead of using a Google Sheet containing a flexible 
  schedule.
- Add feature that allows users to select the number of days prior to the 
  event in which they would like the reminder email to be sent.
- Add a setting that allows users to specify a threshold number of scheduled 
  participants required to avoid sending a warning message to self.
- Add a setting that allows the user to mute warning messages.
- Implement suggested searches for column labels (a trie data structure?)
- Add a setting where users manually set their timezone
  - JS' `Date` object relies on the client's timezone. Google's add-on API sets 
    Google as the client. Note: userTimezone.id â€” the user's timezone 
    identifier (e.g. America/New_York).

The following planned features are currently on indefinite hold until certain
features of the Google API are implemented:

- Initialize settings on install. Currently not possible due to limitations on
  `appscript.json` triggers.
- Trigger add-on build on add-on icon click. Currently not possible due to
  limitations on `appscript.json` triggers.
- Improve add-on's aesthetic design. Currently not possible due to styling
  limitations of the Google CardService API.
